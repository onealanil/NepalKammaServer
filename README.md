# NepalKaamma Backend (In Development 🚧)

**NepalKaamma Backend** is the Node.js Express server powering the NepalKaamma app. It provides RESTful APIs for user management, job listings, bookings, real-time messaging (via Socket.io), and more. The backend is designed to be scalable, efficient, and tailored for Nepal's unique gig-economy ecosystem.

> 🖥️ *Think of it as the engine behind the NepalKaamma platform — managing users, jobs, chats, and services.*
